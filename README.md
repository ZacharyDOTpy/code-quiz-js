# JS Code Quiz

## Descricption

In this challenge I used JavaScript to allow the user to interact with buttons on the page. When the user clicks on buttons the page will switch screens or render different questions depending on the button pressed. The score will also be decreased if the answer is wrong and stored to local storage with the initials of the user once the initials form is filled out and submitted.
